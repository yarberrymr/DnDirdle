# DnDirdle
##Explanation
This is just a simple game that I am modeling off of Wordle and Squirdle, but with Dungeons and Dragons monsters.

The game will tell you how close your guess is based on the following: 
-Challenge Rating
-Size
-Type
-Alignment
-Hit Points

The game will only consist of monsters from 5e at the beginning. 

##Disclaimer
This game is a work in progress as I am still learning how to use API's and laying out a website with HTML and CSS.
